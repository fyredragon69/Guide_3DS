2. Type `4`, then press Enter
3. Once the window says "Removed trigger file", type `0` and then press Enter
4. Reinsert the SD card into your console
5. Power on your console
6. Return to [Section II Step 1](installing-boot9strap-\(mset9-cli\)#section-ii---mset9)

这说明你放的 `boot.firm` 文件有问题。 如果你的主机正在使用 [boot9strap 1.4](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap/releases/tag/1.4) 版，那么你的主机在这种情况下开机后，通知灯就会亮起某种特定的颜色，然后关机。 具体亮起的颜色可用来判断你内存卡或主机内存中的 `boot.firm` 的问题。 On older versions of boot9strap, the blue light will power off almost immediately when trying to turn on the console.

如果通知灯亮起：

- **White**: Your 3DS was not able to find `boot.firm` on your SD card or on internal memory.
- **Magenta**: Your 3DS was not able to find `boot.firm` on your SD card. 主机内存中可以找到 `boot.firm` 文件，但是文件已损坏。
- **Red**: Your 3DS was able to find `boot.firm` on both your SD card and on internal memory, but both files are corrupted.

你可以通过下载 [最新版本的 Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest)，然后解压，将 `boot.firm` 复制到 SD 卡的根目录。 如果 `boot.firm` 始终被主机判定为损坏，则你可能需要使用一个工具来测试一下你的 SD 卡（[Windows](h2testw-\(windows\))、[Linux](f3-\(linux\))、[macOS](f3xswift-\(mac\))） 另外，最好不要使用 WinRAR 解压文件，解压的文件给 3DS 使用可能会出问题。

If you hear a "popping sound", potentially accompanied with the backlight turning on for a split second, there is a hardware issue with your console (such as a disconnected backlight cable). You may be able to get your console to boot by holding it at certain angles.

:::details My console gets stuck on a black screen with blue power light staying on

你可以把下面所列出的方法都试试，此处将方法从最省时到最耗时的顺序排列。

1. Power off your console, remove the SD card, re-insert it, then power on your console.
2. Power off your console, eject the game cartridge if inserted, power on your console, then wait up to ten minutes. If your console boots within ten minutes, the issue has been fixed and is unlikely to reoccur
3. 将 SD 卡上的 `Nintendo 3DS` 文件夹重命名为 `Nintendo 3DS_BACKUP`，然后尝试启动主机。 If your console successfully boots, there is some issue within your `Nintendo 3DS` folder. 尝试清理主菜单的外部存储文件：
   - Navigate to `/Nintendo 3DS/<ID0>/<ID1>/extdata/00000000/`
   - 删除对应你的 3DS 区域的文件夹：
     - **EUR Region**: `00000098`
     - **JPN Region**: `00000082`
     - **USA Region**: `0000008f`
     - **CHN Region**: `000000A1`
     - **KOR Region**: `000000A9`
     - **TWN Region**: `000000B1`
4. 尝试启动到恢复模式并升级系统：
   - 将主机关机
   - Hold (Left Shoulder) + (Right Shoulder) + (D-Pad Up) + (A)
   - Power on your console
   - If you were successful, the console will boot to an "update your system" screen
5. 尝试做 [CTRTransfer](ctrtransfer)
6. 如需援助，请加入 [Nintendo Homebrew Discord 服务器](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp)并使用英文求助。（请注意，如果你身处中国大陆，访问 Discord 可能需要科学上网），你也可以到译者的 [QQ 群](https://stray-soul.site/index.php/qqgroup) 寻求帮助，群号为 942052497。

### Error message on boot

:::details "An error has occurred: Failed to apply 1 FIRM patch(es)" or "An exception has occurred -- Current process: pm"

你主机的 Luma3DS 版本已过时。 下载最新版本的 [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest) 并将 `boot.firm` 放在你 SD 卡的根目录中，如有存在相同文件请替换。 请不要用 WinRAR 解压 ZIP 文件，我们目前已知这会导致与 3DS 有关的文件出错。

:::

:::details "Unable to mount CTRNAND or load the CTRNAND FIRM. Please use an external one."

There are a number of reasons as to why this could be happening. In any case, this error can usually be fixed by following the [CTRTransfer](ctrtransfer) guide.

:::

:::details "An error has occurred. Hold down the POWER button to turn off the power..."

ARM11 异常处理器已被禁用，或主机未安装自制固件。 Try enabling ARM11 exception handlers:

- 将主机关机
- Hold (Select)
- Power on your console, while still holding (Select)
- If the "Disable ARM11 exception handlers" box is checked, uncheck it

:::

:::details HOME Menu is missing installed applications

This could be caused by various reasons, but most likely because your SD card is not being read by the system.
You can check if your SD is being read by holding SELECT on boot and checking the yellow text on the bottom screen; if it says "Booted from CTRNAND via B9S", then your console is booting from the internal memory and not from the SD card.
If this is the case, attempt the steps below, which are listed from easiest to hardest:

1. Power off your console, remove the SD card, re-insert it, then power on your console
2. Power off your console, remove the SD card, insert it on your computer, download the latest release of [Luma3DS](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/releases/latest), extract `boot.firm` from the `Luma3DS.zip` and place it on the root of your SD card (replacing any existing file)
3. Power off your console, remove the SD card, insert it on your computer and reformat your SD card according to your computer's operating system: [Windows](formatting-sd-\(windows\)), [macOS](formatting-sd-\(mac\)), [Linux](formatting-sd-\(linux\)) _(this will wipe your SD card data)_
4. Test your SD card for errors by following the guide according to your computer's operating system: [Windows](h2testw-\(windows\)), [Linux](f3-\(linux\)), [macOS](f3xswift-\(mac\)). If your SD card is marked as faulty, then you will have to replace your SD card
5. Your SD card slot may be broken. Join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for further assistance

:::details Blue "BOOTROM ERROR" screen

Your console is likely hard-bricked. You will need to buy an ntrboot flashcart to reinstall boot9strap in order to attempt to fix your console. 这也可能是无法修复的硬件问题。 无论如何，请先加入 [Nintendo Homebrew Discord 服务器](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) 并说英文求助。（请注意，如果你身处中国大陆，访问 Discord 可能需要科学上网），你也可以到译者的 [QQ 群](https://stray-soul.site/index.php/qqgroup)寻求帮助，群号为 942052497。
\+ 还有可能有人设了一个看上去就像变砖了的开机画面。 Try leaving your console powered on, waiting on the blue screen, for five minutes.
